AI analyzes emotions and generates structured JSON output.

Recommender Agent fetches songs matching your mood (via Spotify / Last.fm API).

Album art, artist info, and preview links shown in a clean UI.

Multi-agent architecture: Mood Analyzer Agent + Recommender Agent.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Vite

Backend: Node.js + Express

AI: OpenAI / DeepSeek LLMs

Music Data: Spotify API / Last.fm API

## 📚 GenAI Concepts Used (7 Marks)

Each concept below is worth 1 mark:

### 1. Zero-shot Prompting

The Mood Analyzer can understand user emotions without examples.

Example: “Extract primary and secondary emotions from this text and return JSON.”

### 2. Dynamic Prompting

Prompts adapt based on user preferences (e.g., exclude sad songs if requested).

### 3. System & User Prompts

System prompt sets the agent role (“You are MoodAnalyzer…”), while the user provides mood input.

### 4. Structured Output

Responses are enforced in JSON for easy parsing by the frontend.

### 5. Temperature

Controls creativity of recommendations (low = safe picks, high = diverse picks).

### 6. Top P (Nucleus Sampling)

Ensures balance between trending hits and niche tracks.

### 7. Function Calling

AI triggers backend functions like getSongDetails() to fetch Spotify data.
